iOS-0615 — Team BadBoys3 (Traveler App)

##What?
Traveller (←working title) is a touring experience marketplace app for tourists, connecting tourists with tours offered by local, culturally-embedded tour-guides.

##Who?
Traveller targets the tourist who is open and searching for new and genuine experiences of the place and culture he is traversing. To enhance that experience, Traveller may possibly offer a number of tour-guide tools to make the experience seamless, lower the barrier of entry for the would-be-amateur-tourguide, and in general grease the wheels of the interaction.

##Where?
Low-hanging fruit will be picked first, but considering the breadth of the relevant APIs, the app should be easily extensible to all locations of tourist interest.

##When?
Yesterday. Who put this question in here??? :D

##How?
1. Workthrough the basic UX.
2. Wireframes and mockups.
3. Technology review, e.g.:
..+ UI tech.
..+ Maps (Apple or Google)
..+ Database (Parse?)
4. MVP/MFS (mimimum feature set)
5. To infinity...and beyond!
6. (There is no...rule \#6)...
